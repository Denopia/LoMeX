# LoMeX

LoMeX is a long k-mer extraction program that utilizes spaced seeds. This program consists of two separate programs: a modified version of an existing k-mer extraction program Squeakr (https://github.com/splatlab/squeakr), and the actual LoMeX program itself.

## Requirements
SpacedSeedSqueakr has the same dependencies as the original Squeakr program, which can be found here https://github.com/splatlab/squeakr .
If SpacedSeedSqueakr works, LoMeX should work too (Not sure about this, check if there are additional dependencies).

## Installation

1. Download the project directory.
2. Install modified Squeakr.
- Go to ```SpacedSeedSqueakr``` directory and run command ```make squeakr```
3. Install LoMeX.
- Go to ```LoMeX``` directory and run command ```make```
